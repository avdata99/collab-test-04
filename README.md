# OKFN Collaborative Documentation tool

This is a GitHub template to create multilanguage collaborative documentation with a
public html site and a PDF version. It's based on [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).   

## Creating my first documentation

At this [repo url](https://github.com/okfn/okfn-collaborative-docs/)
click on the _Use this template_ + _Create new repository_ button
or go directly to the [generate from template url](https://github.com/okfn/okfn-collaborative-docs/generate)

![Use template](docs/imgs/use-template.png)

Do not forget to define your new repository as **Public**.  

### Prepare your local environment.

This is an example for Linux/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Clone your new repository 
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
# Create a Python3 virtual environment
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
# Activate the virtual environment
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
# Install the project requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

### Define your custom settings

Your main configuration file is `/conf/custom.yml`.  

First of all, you need to define your site name and the languages you want to use.  
Define languages at `custom_extra`->`alternate` and the site name at `site_name`.  

```yaml
custom_extra:
  # define all available languages
  alternate:
    - name: English
      lang: en
    - name: Espa√±ol
      lang: es
```

```yaml
site_name:
    en: My site name
    es: Mi sitio
```

You can add as many languages as you want. 
All languages will be required for other multilanguage configurations.  

Now define your URL related settings.

```yaml
site_url: https://okfn.github.io/YOU-REPO-NAME
# Or https:/your-doc-site.org if you have a custom domain and point it to GitHub Pages
repo_url: https://github.com/okfn/YOU-REPO-NAME

# Usually required for github pages. This is a base path for all URLs
public_url_base_path: /YOU-REPO-NAME
# or empty public_url_base_path: 
# if you have a custom domain
```

The `site_description`, `copyright` and `site_author` are self-explanatory.  

If you need to define custom context values to use in your templates, you can do it with the `custom_extra` setting.  

### Define the site structure

The `nav` setting is the main configuration for the site structure.  
Yuo need to add a sub-section for each language (`nav-en`, `nav-es`, etc).  

Inside the `page/docs` folder you need to create (if not exists) a folder
for each language (`docs-en`, `docs-es`, etc).  

### Custom site styles and javascript

If you need custom CSS styles, you can add them to the `page/assets/css/custom.css` file.  
If you need custom javascript, you can add them to the `page/assets/js/app.js` file.  

### Other static resources

If you need other static resources (like images), you can add them to the `page/assets` folder and they will be availabe
at `{{ assets_folder }}` in your template/markdown files (they are several examples available in the test templates).  

### Run your site locally

Prepare your internal custom settings for each language and prepare the environment

```bash
python3 code/okf-collab.py build-config
```
This process will create files and folders:
 - All the `conf/mkdocs-LANG.yml` required files (you don't need to touch them)
 - All the `page/docs/fixed-docs-LANG` required folder with an updated version of your MD files
 - Copy all assets to the `site` folder.

You don't need to touch any of this resources. They are _.gitignored_ and will be used to build the site.  

Build your local site
```
python3 code/okf-collab.py build-local-site
```

Serve the site locally

```
python3 code/okf-collab.py serve
```

You'll see `serving at http://localhost:8033` and your local site is now redy to test with
all the languages you defined.  


### PDF version

A PDF version for each language is generated automatically and it will be available at:
 - English version: `/pdf/doc-en.pdf`
 - Other languages: `/LANG/pdf/doc-LANG.pdf`

The `/page/pdf/pdf-template-LANG` folder include custom styles,
cover and back cover templates for each language.  
[If you know what you're doing](https://github.com/orzih/mkdocs-with-pdf/blob/master/README.md#sample-pdf_event_hookpy-or-pdf_event_hook__init__py),
you can modify the `/pdf_event_hook.py` file.
