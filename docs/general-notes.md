# How to create new documentation

Steps to get you page and PDF done:

 - Create a new repo from the [base template](https://github.com/okfn/okfn-collaborative-docs)
 - Modify ``index.md`` at ``docs-en`` and ``docs-es``
 - Create new md files at ``docs-en`` and ``docs-es`` folders
    - Include them at ``nav`` section at ``mkdocs-en.yml`` and ``mkdocs-es.yml``
 - Put static content at the ``page/assets`` folder (images, css, js, etc).  
 - Replace mkdocs files: okfn-collaborative-docs -> testing-mkdocs-multilang-template **TODO**
 - Enable the ``gh-pages`` branch to be published as GitHub Pages
 - Push! (all languages will be built automatically)

## TODOs

 - Include a PDF link in the header
 - FIX: The edit icon for each page point always to english version
 - Add a step to update github URL and repo name in mkdoc files automatically
 - Allow add or remove languages with a single command
